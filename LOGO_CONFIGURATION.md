# Logo Configuration Guide

The header logo can now be configured directly from the CMS admin panel. Here's how to set it up:

## Accessing Logo Configuration

1. Go to the CMS admin panel
2. Navigate to **Globals** â†’ **Header**
3. You'll find a new "Logo Configuration" section at the top

## Logo Options

### 1. Logo Symbol Only
- Shows only the geometric logo symbol (three overlapping circles)
- No text is displayed
- Perfect for minimal designs

### 2. Logo with Company Name
- Shows the logo symbol + company name text
- You can customize:
  - **Company Name**: Default is "RetailOs"
  - **Logo Color Scheme**: Choose from Default (multi-colored), White, Black, or Primary brand color
  - **Company Name Color**: Choose from White, Black, or Primary brand color

### 3. Custom Logo Image
- Upload your own logo image
- Recommended formats: SVG or PNG with transparent background
- The image will be automatically sized to fit the header height

## Color Schemes

### Logo Symbol Colors
- **Default**: Multi-colored (red, yellow, blue circles)
- **White**: All white circles
- **Black**: All black circles  
- **Primary**: All primary brand color circles

### Text Colors
- **White**: White text (good for dark backgrounds)
- **Black**: Black text (good for light backgrounds)
- **Primary**: Primary brand color text

## Best Practices

1. **Custom Images**: Use SVG format for best quality at all sizes
2. **Transparent Background**: PNG images should have transparent backgrounds
3. **Aspect Ratio**: Keep logo images close to 1:1 ratio for best results
4. **File Size**: Optimize images for web (under 100KB recommended)

## Technical Details

The logo configuration is stored in the Header global and includes:
- Logo type selection
- Custom image upload (Media collection)
- Company name text
- Color scheme preferences
- Text color preferences

All changes are automatically reflected on the frontend without requiring code changes.
